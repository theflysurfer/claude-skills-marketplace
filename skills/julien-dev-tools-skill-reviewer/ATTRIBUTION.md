## Purpose

Addresses the need for systematic quality assurance in skill development. Skills often require multiple iterations to reach production quality, and this skill automates the review and improvement process.

## Inspiration

Based on the quality rubric from Anthropic's skill-creator, extended with:
- DRY principle enforcement
- Progressive disclosure validation
- Automated iteration workflow
- Concrete refactoring suggestions

## Dependencies

- Follows quality dimensions from skill-creator (Step 6: Iterate with Self-Assessment)
- Complements skill-creator-pro's Skill Chaining framework
- Uses same 9-dimension scoring rubric for consistency

## Innovation

First skill to provide automated, iterative quality improvement with:
- Self-review capability (LLM reviews its own skill creations)
- DRY violation detection with specific fixes
- Progressive disclosure refactoring
- Iterative improvement until quality threshold met
- Before/after score tracking
